# AVRPICBoard

## Description
This is a [LibrePCB](https://librepcb.org) project!
AVR/PIC Board is a microcontroller module for my Master Degree. 
The module can be used for educational purposes powered by ATtiny85 and PIC10F320. 
 The target of the project is to use  Assembly languages
  for  AVR/ PIC microcontrollers together.
  It will be used for PhD Degree @ TU-Plovdiv.
## Research paper for the project
